## Books

In progress:

### [Head First Design Patterns](head-first-design-patterns)
- [Strategy Pattern](head-first-design-patterns/ch_01_strategy_pattern/ch_01_code.ts) - Behavioral design pattern that enables defining a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one, and making them interchangeable.
- [Observer Pattern](head-first-design-patterns/ch_02_observer_pattern/ch_02_the_observer_pattern.md) - Behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they're observing.
- [Decorator Pattern](head-first-design-patterns/ch_03_decorator_pattern/notes.md) - Structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special objects that contain behaviors.
- [Factory Pattern](head-first-design-patterns/ch_04_factory_pattern/notes.md) - Creational design pattern, that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows ubclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- [Singleton Pattern](head-first-design-patterns/ch_05_singleton_pattern/notes.md) - Creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing global access point to this instance.
- [Command Pattern](head-first-design-patterns/ch_06_command_pattern/notes.md) - Behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This lets you pass requests as a method argument, delay or queue request's execution, and support undo/redo operations.
- [Facade and Adapter Pattern](head-first-design-patterns/ch_07_adapter_and_facade_pattern/notes.md) - Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes. Adapter is a structrual design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate (facilitates interoperability).
- [Template Method Pattern](head-first-design-patterns/ch_08_template_pattern/notes.md) - Behavioral design pattern taht defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass, allowing subclasses to override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
- [Iterator and Composite Patterns](head-first-design-patterns/ch_09_iterator_and_composite_pattern/notes.md) - Iterator is a behavioral design pattern that lets your traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representing (list, tree, stack, etc). Composite is a structural design pattern that lets your compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.
